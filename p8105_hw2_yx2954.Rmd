## Description

The original dataset contains different types of **variables**, **including character**, **logical variable** and double-precision floating point (**numeric variable**); As for the information, it contains **detailed information about subway stations, including station name, exact locations, the routes they serve, entrance/exit information, ADA compliance, vending availability, staffing information, entrance location, corner location and whether the station allows free crossovers**.
The original dataset has gone through a series of data cleaning process, including **imputing missing data, data pruning, converting the character variable of ADA to logical variable, and normalizing the header into a more cleaning way**. The cleaned data has a dimension of **1,868 Ã— 32**. The data is **tidy**, as now each entry is finely positioned without mixing.
